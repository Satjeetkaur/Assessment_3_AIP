The Design style for this applications are based on below points.

1. Braces - Opening brakets go on the same line.
2. For the VARIABLES & PROPERTY names we are going to use lower camel case capitalization.
3. CONSTANT should be in all uppercase.
4. We try to avoid code dulication as it is bad style instead of that we can use function and calling.
5. Indentation should be in correct manner and using a eqal spacing.
6. Comment should be meaningful and able to explain the code.
7. We are using a short identifier as it is convenient to use and also easier to type.
8. Classes name in uppercamel case as it is helpful to distinguish class and methods.
